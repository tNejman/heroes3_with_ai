/**
 * @brief
 * This class performs an operation of loading a .txt file,
 * parsing it and creating an instance of WorldMap,
 * based on file parsed; turns 0,1,2,etc. to Terrain using enum from ProjectLib.
 *
 * @details
 * @param y_counter starts from WORLD_MAP_HEIGHT - 1 and not 0, because the .txt file is parsed
 * from top to bottom, so to keep the same orientation of the file and the map visual,
 * MapLoader iterates through WorldMap grid in reverse order vertically.
 *
 * In getObjectFromContainer() y_counter_ is asserted to have
 * the value of 4'294'967'295 because it is decremented one too many times,
 * which causes the value to turn from 0 to uint32_t.max_val
